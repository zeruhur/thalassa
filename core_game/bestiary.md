### Creating Monsters
Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or NPC:

**Name**
X STA, X Armor, X KRA, X TEK, X THU, Weapon (dX, special items, qualities)
- Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor.
- Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique.
- Special effect or critical damage consequence.

**General Principles**  
Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.  
- Give average creatures 3 STA, give hardy ones 6 STA, and serious threats get 10+ STA.
- Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
- Remember that STA is **Hit Protection** , not Hit Points. It's a measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

**Converting from OSR Games**  
- Give 1 STA per HD for most creatures.
- Most humanoids have at least 4HP.
- **Morale** can also be used as a baseline.

Some pointers:  
- Is it good at avoiding a hit? Give it STA.
- Does it soak up damage? Give it Armor.
- Is it strong? Give it a high **KRA**.
- Is it nimble? Give it high **TEK**.
- Is it charismatic? Give it high **THU**.

Damage die are roughly the same, though armed attacks do at least 1d6 damage.
