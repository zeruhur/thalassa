# Credits

*Thálassa* is based on the Cairn SRD by Yochai Gal (release under CC BY-SA 4.0 license) which derived from Weird North by Jim Parkin, Into the Odd by Chris McDowall, and Knave by Ben Milton.

A huge thanks to:

- Yochai Gal: for Cairn, the NSR Discord server, and the kind support.
- Tom Van Winkle: for correcting all the Greek words and addressing me on magic in the ancient world.
- Alessio Persichetti: for all the valuable advice and for tolerating my lucubrations.
- Giovanni Tamba: for directing me on monster stats with his advice. 
- The NSR and The Cauldron communities: for advice and support on this project.
