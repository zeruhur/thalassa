# Magic
In the world of Thálassa there are two kinds of magic: **Eukhé** is the invocation of divine powers and **Goïteia** is reciting incantations.

Everyone may use magic and Thumos is the power source. Each time an incantation, invocation, curse or divination is casted, the magic-user consumes THU equal to 1d6 points. This determines the current level of THU until recovered (the same rule for STA in [Healing](#healing) do apply).

## Eukhé

Eukhé is the highest form of magic. It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke Gods in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them or ask them a blessing. It is a power higher than all human wisdom embracing the blessings of divination, the purifying powers of initiation and all the operations of divine possession.

The practitioner evokes the God competent for a specific domain on which he wants to have effect:

- **Apollo**: divination and healing.
- **Ares**: might in battle.
- **Artemis**: protection in the night and charms in the hunt.
- **Aphrodite**: love charms and potions. 
- **Athena**: insights and strategy.
- **Hermes**: thievery and trickery.
- **Hephaestus**: blessing weapons and armors.
- **Hera**: blessing marital unions.
- **Persephone**: calling upon the souls of the dead.
- **Poseidon**: control over sea and weather

A time of recollection and concentration is required to appeal to the deity, equal to 1d6 turns. Then roll 1d20: if the result is 16+, the deity hears and grants the request. In any case the practice will consume THU like any other magic.

## Goïteia

Goïteia is the lowest form of magic, including astrology, alchemy and other forms of esoteric knowledge and not well regarded in Ellas. It originated in Egypt where the high priests drew on primal power with *heka*. Over the centuries they have written precise forms, in the form of incantations, to evoke this form of energy. This knowledge was taken away and vulgarized by some outcast priests and then exported to foreign peoples. The incantations thus handed down are limited in number and power and their effects constrained by the precise wording. 

**A scroll** contain a single incantations and take up one slot. They cannot be created nor transcribed, but can be recovered from places like labyrinths. If the PC is deprived or in danger, the odigós may require a PC to make a save against THU to avoid any ill-effects from reciting the incantation. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect, and may result in added Fatigue, the destruction of the Spellbook, injury, and even death.

Alternatively, it is possible to memorize the content of the scroll to avoid slots consumption. In this case, the practitioner takes 1 day to memorize the incantation and then they burn the scroll. Save against THU, failing results in the loss of the spell and the need to find another copy.

## Amulets & Talisman
An amulet is an object believed to confer protection upon its possessor. Also a talisman is any object intended to protect, heal, or harm individuals for whom they are made, but a key difference is in their form and materiality, with talismans often taking the form of objects like clothing, weaponry, or parchment inscribed with magic texts.
Some examples of function are:
- Demon Protection
- Restraining Seal
- Phylactery 
- Ring for success and favor and victory.
