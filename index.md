# Welcome to **Thálassa** official website!

**Thálassa** is an adventure game for one facilitator (the odigós) and at least one other player set in the Mythical Age sung by Hesiod and Homer.

Players act as fearless explorers of the Mediterranean of the Mythical Age, studded with mysterious islands, thick forests, legendary creatures, labyrinths and dangers.

## Why I designed this

In Italy where I was born and still live, classical myths are part of any student’s education. Since middle school they have been a passion that have accompanied me through the decades and that I have always wanted to see transposed into RPGs.

This is my attempt to stay true to the original sources without adding a lot of interpolation, but keeping the rulebook playable.

It would not have been possible to write a ruleset like this without the availability of Into The Odd, Weird North, and Cairn’s SRD, and I thank their authors for making their games available to hacks.
