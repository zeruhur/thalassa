# Seafaring Adventures

The World of Th√°lassa has the Sea at its core and it is surrounded by The Ocean. Travel by sea is a common, yet dangerous, mean of transportation. 

Peoples and communities communicate and trade through routes, even if they cannot rely on equipment such as a sextant or compass. Navigation is preferably done by keeping the coast in sight, stopping at night, and orienting with the sun, stars, and coastal features (if known).

Venturing out on a quest is a risky endeavor that involves facing unknown seas and the vagaries of climate, landing on mysterious islands to obtain supplies and meeting enigmatic peoples and legendary creatures.
