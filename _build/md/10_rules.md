# Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances (see **saves**, below).

- **Kratos (KRA)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

- **Tekhne (TEK)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

- **Thumos (THU)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, recite incantations, etc.

### Saves
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they roll *equal to or under that ability score*, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

**Example:** *Althea encounters a group of wild harpies standing guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course, recognizing that her 13 TEK makes sneaking past the guards the best option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success!*

### Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to recover STA or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).  

### Healing
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost STA but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss can usually be restored with a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise. Some of these services may be free, while more expedient or magical means of recovery may come at a cost.

### Armor
Before calculating damage to STA, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.  
No one can have more than 3 Armor.  
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according to their use.

### Reactions  
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the odigós may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|         |      |         |      |         |
|---------|------|---------|------|---------|
| 2       | 3-5  | 6-8     | 9-11 | 12      |
| Hostile | Wary | Curious | Kind | Helpful |


### Morale
Enemies must pass a THU save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader's THU in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 STA. Morale does not affect PCs.

### Companions
PCs can hire **companions** to aid them in their expeditions. To create a companion, roll 3d6 for each ability score, then give them 1d6 STA and a simple weapon (d6), then roll on the [**Character Creation**](#character-creation) tables to further flesh them out. Companions cost between 1-3ec per day, or a share of whatever treasure the party obtains.

### Wealth & Treasure
The most common coin is the electrum (e), which is equal to 10 silver (s) and 100 copper (c).

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages,strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.
