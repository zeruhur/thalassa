# Combat

### Rounds
The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time and is comprised of turns.

### Actions
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting an incantation, attacking, making a second move, or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled. If a character attempts something risky, the odigós calls for a save for appropriate players or NPCs. All actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.

### Turns
The odigós will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or monsters. At the start of combat, each PC must make a TEK save to act before their opponents.

**Example:** *Althea has accidentally stumbled onto the stomping grounds of a massive Cyclop. In order to make a move before the Cyclop, she makes a TEK save. She fails, and the Cyclop gets to attack first.*

### Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's STA. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

**Example:** *The Cyclop roars, swinging its club at Althea, who has 5 STA. The club does 1d10 damage and the odigós rolls a 4. They subtract 1 to account for Althea's leather armor, leaving Althea with 2 STA remaining*.

### Multiple Attackers
If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage *regardless* of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced** , allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

### Dual Weapons
If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

### Blast
Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related damage die for a result.

### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's STA below zero decreases a target's KRA by the amount remaining. They must then make a KRA save to avoid **critical damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a critical damage save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize. If left untreated, they die within the hour.

### Ability Score Loss
If a PC's KRA is reduced to 0, they die. If their TEK is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their THU is reduced to 0, they are delirious.
Complete TEK and THU loss renders the character unable to act until they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.  

### Unconsciousness & Death
When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of a companion. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

### Detachments
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 KRA, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are impaired (excluding blast damage).  
Attacks against individuals by detachments are enhanced and deal blast damage.

### Retreat
Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful TEK save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

### Scars
When an attack reduces a PC's STA to exactly 0, they are uniquely impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total damage taken:

|    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 3  | Walloped: You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded. You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add that amount to your max STA.                                                         |

| 7  | Hamstrung: You can barely move until you get serious help and rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max TEK, take the new result.                                                               |
| 8  | Deafened: You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary aid. Regardless, make a THU save. If you pass, increase your max THU by 1d4.                                                                               |
| 9  | Re-brained: Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose. Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max THU, take the new result.                                                                                     |
| 10 | Sundered: An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The odigós will tell you which. Then, make a THU save. If you pass, increase your max THU by 1d6.                                                                 |
| 11 | Mortal Wound: You are deprived and out of action. You die in one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max STA.                                                                         |
| 12 | Doomed: Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived. If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly. If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max STA, take the new result. |
