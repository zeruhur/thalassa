# Rules Summary

**ACTIONS**  
On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. Actions may include casting an incantation, attacking, making a second move, or other reasonable activities. Actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously. Whenever turn order is uncertain, the PCs should make a TEK save to see if they go before their enemies.

**Retreating** from a dangerous situation always requires a successful TEK save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

**ABILITIES**  
- **KRA:** Brawn, prowess & resistance.   
- **TEK:** Dodging, sneaking & reflexes.   
- **THU:**  Persuasion, intimidation & magic.

**SAVES**  
- Roll a d20 equal to or under an ability.
- 1 is always a success, 20 is always a failure.

**STAMINA**  
**STA** indicates a PC's ability to avoid getting hurt. It is lost during combat & recovered after a few moment's rest.

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have a total of inventory slots equal to their KRA. Most items take up a one slot, but smaller items can be bundled. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry.

Filling all ten item slots reduces a PC to 0 STA. PCs cannot carry more than their inventory allows, though carts & horses may provide an increase in slots.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** PCs cannot recover STA. If deprived for more than a day,they add a **Fatigue** to inventory. Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until they can recover in safety. This effect is cumulative.

**HEALING**  
A moment's rest and a swig of water will restore lost STA, but may leave the party vulnerable. **Ability** loss requires a week's rest and the aid of a skilled healer.

**MAGIC**
In the world of Thálassa there are two kinds of magic: **Eukhé** is the invocation of divine powers and **Goïteia** is reciting incantations.

Everyone may use magic and Thumos is the power source. Each time an incantation, invocation, curse or divination is casted, the magic-user consumes THU equal to 1d6 points. This determines the current level of THU until recovered (the same rule for STA in Healing do apply).

**COMBAT**  
The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's Armor, then deals the remaining total to their opponent's STA.

Before calculating damage to STA, subtract the target's **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. If **multiple attackers** target the same foe, roll all damaged ice and keep the single highest result. If attacking with **two weapons** at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the highest.

If an attack is **impaired** , the damage die is reduced to 1d4, regardless of weapon. If the attack is **enhanced** , the attacker rolls 1d12. Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
If an attack takes a PC's STA exactly to 0, the player rolls on the **Scars** table.

Damage that reduces a target's STA **below** 0 decreases their KRA by the remainder. They must then make a KRA save to avoid **critical damage.**  Failure takes them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having KRA 0 means **death;** having TEK 0 is paralysis; having THU 0 is delirium.
