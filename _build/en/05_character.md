# Character Creation

### Name, Origin & Traits
First, choose or roll a **name** for your character from the [**Background**](#background-d20) tables, and their **origin**, indicating where they come from.

Next, roll for the rest of your character's **traits** (appearance, speech, mannerisms, beliefs, reputation, etc.) on the [**Character Traits**](#character-traits-d10) tables.

Finally, roll for their **age** (2d20+10).

### Ability Scores  
Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:  
- ***kratos* (KRA)** (strength)
- ***tekhne*  (TEK)** (nimbleness)
- ***thumos* (THU)** (control)

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

**Example:**   
*Ines rolls for her character's **KRA**, resulting in a **2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability rolls result in a **9** for **TEK** and a **13** for **THU**. She decides to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9 KRA**, **12 TEK** and **13** **THU**.*

### Stamina
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Stamina** (STA), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. STA does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's STA exactly to 0, the player must roll on the **Scars** table.

### Inventory
Characters have a total of inventory slots equal to their KRA: this represents the character's ability to to bear the weight and fatigue of carrying the equipment without being adversely affected.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the odig√≥s' discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 STA.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory.  **Companions** can also be paid to carry equipment.

### Starting Gear
All PCs begin with:

- Three days' rations (one slot)
- A weapon (roll on the related table)
- 3d6 electron coins

Roll on the **Starting Gear** tables to determine your PC's armor, tools, and equipment.

See the **Equipment List** for related armor, damage, and slot values. Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.
